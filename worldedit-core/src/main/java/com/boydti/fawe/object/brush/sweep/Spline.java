     * based on an equidistant distribution of the nodes on the curve. For example: on a spline with 5 nodes position 0.0 would refer

     * By providing this method with the amount of nodes used by the interpolation implementation the distribution of the

     * This means that the distance between two positions used to paste the clipboard (e.g., 0.75 - 0.5 = 0.25) on the curve
     * will always amount to that part of the length (e.g. 40 units) of the curve. In this example it would amount to
     * 0.25 * 40 = 10 units of curve length between these two positions.
