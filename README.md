## Building
FAWE uses gradle to build  
You can safely ignore `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` if you are not planning to work on the forge side of FAWE.

```
$ gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
$ gradlew build
```

The jar is located in `worldedit-bukkit/build/libs/FastAsyncWorldEdit-1.16-###.jar`
